# Mean Finance Bug Bounty

Mean Finance ImmuneFi bug bounty program is focused on the prevention of negative impacts to the Mean Finance ecosystem, which currently covers our smart contracts and integrations. As such, all bug disclosures must be done through ImmuneFi's platform.

**The primary prevention focuses are as follows:**

- Exploits resulting in the locking, loss, or theft of user funds.

- Exploits resulting in protocol insolvency.

- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

- Smart contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesnâ€™t lose value

| **Smart Contracts** |                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Critical            | Up to USD $20,000 |
| High                | USD $10,000       |
| Medium              | USD $2,000        |
| Low                 | USD $1,000        |
